# Face_Recognition
**Title**: Face Recognition with Mask Detection

**Description**:

In this project, I developed a face recognition system using Python that encompasses several key functionalities. The primary goal of the project was to create a robust system capable of recognizing individuals, associating their names with their faces, and determining whether they were wearing masks or not. The project was designed to work with both static images and real-time video feeds.

**Functionalities**:

**Data Collection**: The project initiated by capturing a dataset of 30 images for each individual whose face needed to be recognized. This dataset served as the foundation for training the face recognition model.

**Face Recognition**: The project implemented a deep learning-based face recognition model, utilizing the accuracy of MTCNN-detected faces. This model successfully recognized individuals based on their facial features and associated their names accordingly.

**Mask Detection**: A vital feature of the project was the mask detection module, which employed machine learning techniques. It accurately determined whether a person in an image or video was wearing a mask or not, contributing to public health and safety.

**Real-time Face Detection**: The system seamlessly processed real-time video feeds, identifying faces, recognizing individuals, and assessing mask-wearing status on the fly.

**User Interface**: To enhance usability, a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed, allowing users to interact with the system effortlessly. It enabled users to capture images, view recognition results, and utilize the system's capabilities effectively.

**Outcome**:

By harnessing the power of OpenCV, MTCNN, shutil, and Haar Cascade Classifiers, this project delivered a robust and versatile face recognition system with mask detection capabilities. It effectively recognized individuals, associated their names with their faces, and determined mask-wearing status in real-time. This technology combination addressed critical security and safety challenges in various domains, including access control, public health, and surveillance. The project exemplified the practical applications of advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems.
